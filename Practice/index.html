            <i>Up into the cherry tree<br></i>
            <b>Who should climb but little me? <br></b>
            <i>I held the trunk with both my hands <br></i>
            <b>And looked abroad on foreign lands.<br></b>
            <i>I saw the next door garden lie, <br></i>
            <b>Adorned with flowers, before my eye, <br></b>
            <i>And many pleasant places more <br></i>
            <b>That I had never seen before. <br></b>
