        <div class="card-footer">Norman Borlaug influenced anyone struggling from a lack of food as there where many people who were struggling because of the lack to produce food due to subsistance farming which is a type of farming that is done by hand instead of by machine and therefore only allows the production of food for a small villege or sometimmes only the farmer and the farmers family. Borlaugs interoducton of new crops and GM'S allowed for many people to go into comerical farming and allowed for food to be produced quicker due to new chemicals and fertalizers. This all led to him gaining the title of the man who saved a billion lives. </div>

    <div class="col-lg-8">
       <p>Norman Borlaug was a scientist who had a big influence on the green revolution also known as the third agricultural revolution. The third agricultural revolution was the revolution that introduced chemical pestasides and Geneticaly modified seeds. Because of borlaugs introduction of his new technology  this allowed for people who lived in countries and places that were lacking in production of food to start producing more of a surplus of food which allowed for less starvation leading to the title of the man who saved a billion lives as Borlaug is knowen as. Also the introduction of sustanable agriculture which is a more efficient method of agriculture was introduced. This method of agriculture included the use of less chemicals and pestasides and drip irrigation so you can give the plant just the right amount of water so you do not waste any extra water. Also this led to a decreace in prices of food at the store because more of it could be produced. All this things sparked because of the innovations by Norman Borlaug.<br> <b>Some websites for more information about Norman Borlaug:</b><br><a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug"> Norman Borlaug Wikipedia.</a><br><a href= "https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1970/borlaug/biographical/">Norman Borlaug biography</a><br><a href= "https://www.worldfoodprize.org/en/dr_norman_e_borlaug/about_norman_borlaug/"> More about Norman Borlaug</a></p>
