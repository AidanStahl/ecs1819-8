              <h4>About Alaska and why I picked it to show some photos that I took </h4>
              Alaska is the largest state in the United States and is also the most thinly populated state or most spread out in terms of population out of all the 50 united states. 
              The reason that I picked Alska as a state to show off some photos I have taken is it is a state that has very beautiful scenery and a place where I took some realy breathtaking photos.
              There is lots of small towns and abundant wild life such as bears with lots of mountains and spread out open land. Alaska is a whole diffrent experiance than any other state as it is so diffrent in terms of how it is populated and how it looks around.
              Thoes are some cool things about Alaska.

    <div class="card-header"><b>Fun Fact About Alaska and Photography</b></div>
    <div class="card-body">One fun fact about Alaska is it is it has more of a coastline meaning the outer coast of  a place than the whole united states combined. Also one more fun fact about Alaska as a bonus is it has around 3000 rivers and around 3 million lakes in just Alaksa alone. Thoes are some fun facts about Alaska.
    A fun fact about photography is to get the best shot in the sun you want to have the sun facing you and not the other way around so that way you are able to take a photo with the light focused on you. Also if you have ever wondered what the bust shot feature is if you have a latter generation iPhone that it will have this feature, this feature is used for moving shots such as if someone is jumping and you want to make sure to catch that perfect moment when they are in the air or want to get a good photo of someone running. Thoes are also some fun facts about photography.
